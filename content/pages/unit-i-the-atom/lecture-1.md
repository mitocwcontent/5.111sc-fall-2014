Professor Cathy Drennan introduces this series of lectures about basic chemical principles. She describes her path to becoming a chemist and reveals her first impression of the discipline of chemistry. Goals for students of this material are presented as well as some examples about how real world problems can be solved through the applications of chemical principles. Teaching assistants for the course are introduced.

Significant figures are important. Rules for scientific notation and significant figures are available in the back of our textbook in Appendix 1, pages A5-A6. You are also responsible for knowing the following SI prefixes: n (nano, 10\-9), μ (micro, 10\-6), m (milli, 10\-3), c (centi, 10\-2), and k (kilo, 103).

Problems and Solutions
----------------------

Review problems to complete before continuing to lecture 2. Students are expected to know this material, which is not covered in class.
