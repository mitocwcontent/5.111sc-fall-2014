Course Overview
---------------

This page focuses on the course _5.111 Principles of Chemical Science_ as it was taught by Professor Catherine Drennan, with assistance from Course Coordinator, Allena Mistral Goren, in Fall 2014.

This course provides an introduction to the chemistry of biological, inorganic, and organic molecules. The emphasis is on basic principles of atomic and molecular electronic structure, thermodynamics, acid-base and redox equilibria, chemical kinetics, and catalysis.

Course Outcomes
---------------

### Course Goals for Students

*   Gain a working knowledge of chemical principles that will allow one to take advanced chemistry classes
*   Appreciate how chemistry is used to solve real-world problems
*   Make informed decisions about one's health, environmental and energy issues, and science policy
*   Advance science and engineering through the application of chemical principles
*   Employ chemistry in one's research in a non-chemistry department laboratory

### Breakdown by Year

Mostly freshman

### Breakdown by Major

Most students have not yet finalized their majors.

### Typical Student Background

Not all students who enroll in _5.111 Principles of Chemical Science_ come to the course already enthusiastic about chemistry. The course offers them an opportunity to see how chemistry is a modern subject shaping many fields and how it can offer tools useful for solving real-world problems. Learn more about how Professor Drennan conceptualizes [5.111 as a course in which students can develop a passion for chemistry]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/5).

How Student Time Was Spent
--------------------------

During an average week, students were expected to spend 12 hours on the course, roughly divided as follows:

In Class
--------

*   Met 3 times per week for 1 hour per session; 39 sessions total; mandatory attendance.
*   Class sessions included lectures, demonstrations, and clicker questions.
*   During lectures, students completed blanks in detailed handouts provided by the instructor.

Recitation
----------

*   Met 2 times per week for 1 hour per session; 26 sessions total; mandatory attendance.
*   Recitations included problem solving, review of concepts, and opportunities to ask questions about course material.

Out of Class
------------

Students completed problem sets and prepared for exams outside of class. They also participated in [pizza forums]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/pizza-forums-connecting-with-students-in-a-large-lecture-class), which were opportunities to get to know the professor in small group settings.
