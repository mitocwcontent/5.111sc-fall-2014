**Description:** Embedded video, no tabs, this description appears on section page: Lewis structures are simplistic views of molecular structure. They are based on the idea that the key to covalent bonding is electron sharing and having each atom achieve a noble gas electron configuration. Lewis structures correctly predict electron configurations around atoms in molecules about 90% of the time. They are not perfect, but writing a Lewis structure is a lot easier than solving the Schr√∂dinger equation, so we recommend that you watch this lecture.
