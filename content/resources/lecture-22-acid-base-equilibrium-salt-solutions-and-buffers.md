**Description:** Embedded video, no tabs, this description appears on section page: A buffer helps to maintain a constant pH. Our blood has a natural buffering system to ensure that the pH of our blood stays within a narrow window and that we stay health. In this lecture, we consider how to design a buffer. We also discuss how one can predict the pH of a salt solution. At dinner if you put table salt in your water glass, how would the pH of the water change? or would it change?
