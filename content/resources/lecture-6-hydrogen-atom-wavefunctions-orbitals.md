**Description:** Embedded video, no tabs, this description appears on section page: Where is that electron anyway? In this lecture, the probability of finding an electron at a particular distance from the nucleus is discussed. The concept of wavefunctions (orbitals) is introduced, and applications of electron spin are described. In particular, chemist Ben Ofori-Okai introduces us to the wonders of magnetic resonance imaging, also known as MRIs.

**Instructor:** Catherine Drennan
