**Description:** Embedded video, no tabs, this description appears on section page: Thermodynamics is key to understanding the reactivity of molecules and compounds. In this first of three lectures on thermodynamics, viewers are introduced to âˆ†H, and asked to consider how much heat it will take to break one type of molecular bond versus another. Viewers are also asked whether a particular chemical reaction will release heat or absorb heat.

**Instructor:** Catherine Drennan
